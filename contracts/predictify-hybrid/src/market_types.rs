// ===== MARKET STATE =====

/// Enumeration of possible market states throughout the prediction market lifecycle.
///
/// This enum defines the various states a prediction market can be in, from initial
/// creation through final resolution and closure. Each state represents a distinct
/// phase with specific business rules, available operations, and state transition
/// requirements.
///
/// # State Lifecycle
///
/// The typical market progression follows this pattern:
/// ```text
/// Active → Ended → [Disputed] → Resolved → Closed
/// ```
///
/// **Alternative flows:**
/// - **Cancellation**: `Active → Cancelled` (emergency situations)
/// - **Direct Resolution**: `Active → Resolved` (admin override)
/// - **Dispute Flow**: `Ended → Disputed → Resolved`
///
/// # State Descriptions
///
/// **Active**: Market is live and accepting user participation
/// - Users can place votes and stakes
/// - Market question and outcomes are fixed
/// - Oracle configuration is immutable
/// - Voting period is ongoing
///
/// **Ended**: Market voting period has concluded
/// - No new votes or stakes accepted
/// - Oracle resolution can be triggered
/// - Community consensus can be calculated
/// - Dispute period may be active
///
/// **Disputed**: Market resolution is under dispute
/// - Formal dispute process is active
/// - Additional evidence may be collected
/// - Dispute resolution mechanisms engaged
/// - Final outcome pending dispute resolution
///
/// **Resolved**: Market outcome has been determined
/// - Final outcome is established
/// - Payouts can be calculated and distributed
/// - Resolution method and confidence recorded
/// - Market moves toward closure
///
/// **Closed**: Market is permanently closed
/// - All payouts have been distributed
/// - No further operations allowed
/// - Market data preserved for historical analysis
/// - Final state for completed markets
///
/// **Cancelled**: Market has been cancelled
/// - Emergency cancellation due to issues
/// - Stakes returned to participants
/// - No winner determination
/// - Administrative action required
///
